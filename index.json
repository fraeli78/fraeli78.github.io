Or will only  Google Maps suffice?\nWill you have to enroll in a university course? Take a paid online course?\nNone of these!\nCompared to twenty years ago, when  ESRI was the undisputed master in GIS and social networks had not overwhelmingly entered our daily life, it was rather complicated to find useful information to solve our problems.\nToday, we face the opposite problem. We continually receive input from different sources and it is increasingly difficult to select which links to save to go deeper into the topic at a later stage.\nHere my work comes into play. I have attended many courses on different online platforms such as Udacity, Udemy, Coursera and LinkedIn Learning as well as standard courses on site of universities and private companies. I also analyzed thousands of tweets on twitter and posts on Linkedin to select the best sites from which you can learn for free.\nIf you are interested in learning more about it because you want to become an expert or simply because you are curious to find out what you can do with a GIS, you can find my recipe here.\nGit\u0026amp;GitHub It will be very useful in daily activities for various reasons such as:\n To work simultaneously with other people on the same project. Publish your site for free. To store your projects.  You can find useful tutorials here.\nOSGeo \u0026amp; ESRI Learn GIS using the  OSGeoLive (Open Source) and  ESRI (commercial) platforms. I strongly advise you to follow both in order to have a broader perspective. You probably prefer to learn open source rather then ESRI. Remember a lot of job offers require skills on ESRI.\n OSGeoLive is a wonderful opportunity to learn about the Open Source world in its entirety. ESRI - through MOOCs you will be able to obtain licenses to use the platform and obtain a certificate at the end of the course.  The most comprehensive and free sources can be found here.\nPostGIS It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly powerful and you can solve the most complex tasks. You can find a great overview here.\nGDAL It\u0026rsquo;s a great library to convert geospatial data. You can find useful tutorials here.\nWebGIS Need a quick review on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP? You can find them here.\nThe ability to manage WebGIS is undoubtedly the most requested capability as it allows you to share your work with the rest of the world. You can find a great overview here.\nI suggest you learn Leaflet as it is quite simple and there are a lot of documentations for different scenarios. The most comprehensive and free sources can be found here.\nPython There are excellent courses that will allow you to learn step by step. You can find a great overview here.\nOpen Data More and more public bodies are sharing their data online. Often you will have to clean up the data to use them properly in a GIS. I have created a list of the main sites where you can download data for free. You can find them here.\nLicense Last but not least. Whenever you look for a source on the internet it will be useful to know if it is usable or not. Guides can be found here.\nFinal Notes  I recommend you create a Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin account to follow the best profiles on GIS. I recommend you visit a blog list containing the most important news on GIS. I recommend you sign up to Medium and ScienceDirect to receive the best personalized recommendations as per your profile every day. I recommend you create a Stack Overflow account. Here you can ask and find a ton of useful tips.

It’s time for shopping and relaxation. Commercial activities are in full swing. Advertisements flood TV, newspapers, and radio with a ton of last-minute promotions.\nIf you are a new business and you would like to advertise an event to attract new customers, you will sure to be found.\nScribble Maps will make your life easier and help you create a map that can be shared on your digital channels, like social media, your website, and WhatsApp, with directions to your business.\nImagine that your business is in a small town in the Tuscan countryside that only the locals know. You have to look for a way to draw as many customers to you as you can.\nIn order to do this, you should consider major cities or populated areas around you. In this case the airports of Pisa and Florence and the cities of Lucca and Volterra.

Anyone with a smartphone has an app to check weather forecasts for at any given moment. On a daily basis, we are flooded with information on the internet, TV, and radio about climatic events such as:\n The first snowfall in New York; Milan\u0026rsquo;s airport closing due to fog; Children and the elderly are asked to stay at home during the central hours of the day due to torrid weather.  Additionally, we often find reports that show the temperature fluctuation, wind speed variability, and precipitation amounts in cities.\nLast week, we requested the annual average values gathered by the meteorological stations in the major cities of Tuscany. Here is the excel report that we received.\nWe immediately thought about how to report this data in an interactive map so that we can make correlation analyses between the averages and the topographical features of the territory.\nScribble Maps helps us a lot in this. Thanks to the geocode service it will be simple to copy the data from the Excel sheet and paste them on the appropriate spreadsheet. In just a few steps we got three heatmaps with georeferenced data through the geocode.\nWe put a topographic layer as a basemap, for example, google terrain. We can easily see that the lowest temperatures are recorded in the mountainous areas while the highest temperatures are in the locations closest to the sea. The rainiest areas are close to the mountain ranges.\nWe encourage you to replicate this analysis by taking other data from other weather stations in different regions or countries.\nStudents could look for their own region and study the data on a table of an excel sheet first, trying to establish the characteristics of the meteorological station by analyzing the three parameters (wind, rainfall, and temperature). After making their deductions it would be interesting to import the data into Scribble Maps to display them on a map and check if their assumptions were correct.\nFurthermore, we want to recommend another use of the statistical data:\n You could also represent the life quality of major cities in the world. At this link, we found a ranking. Now we already know how to proceed! We have copied and pasted the data and created the map with the markers containing the ranking associated with the city.  Do you have other statistical data to analyze? For example, data on crime? on smog? on poverty?

The maps should contain the national borders, main cities, main communication routes, rivers and lakes. Let us suppose you have a short time to finish the job and you have absolutely nothing at all in your archive. In other words, we have to solve this problem by using only information available on Geospatial Data Portals such as Natural Earth, NASA Earth Observations, The FAO GeoNetwork…, and so on. Over the years they have started to release free sources from global to regional, from agriculture to soils, administrative boundaries, population, marinas, and other themes.\nWell, this premise justifies why to try Scribble Maps.\nIn this article, we focus on some data coming from the Natural Earth portal and we show how to manage and share Physical and Cultural Geography Information in an easy way through Scribble Maps.\nThe maps below are created in a short time with an excellent graphics rendering. We just had to load the data and choose the right basemap as per the data contents. Below is the list of maps with the associated basemap:\nCultural data:\n  Airports =\u0026gt; Map Base Road;  Marinas =\u0026gt; National Geographic Education.  Physical data:\n  Elevation Points =\u0026gt; Google Terrain;  Glaciated Areas =\u0026gt; ESRI Physical.  These maps can be a good starting point to share and discuss the main global geographic topics with students. For example, you may ask your students to collect videos and images related to the marker points around the world. Once they have finished collecting information for the 1st state it should be nice to share it to the rest of the class using Scribble Maps. In this activity, each student can analyze the different basemap archives from Google maps and other providers (ESRI, Open Street Map, Map box, …). Once they have analyzed the Maps generated at the global level they could check which the best basemap is for the chosen area at the local level.\nLet’s start, and share your maps with us!\n  ","date":1552648781,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552648781,"objectID":"ffa2dc03859975ec815623cd24c6fd8c","permalink":"https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/make_thematic_maps_quickly/","publishdate":"2019-03-15T12:19:41+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/scribblemaps/make_thematic_maps_quickly/","section":"post","summary":"Assume that for some reason you need to create some worldwide thematic maps.
