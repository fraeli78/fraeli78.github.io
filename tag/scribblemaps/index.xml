      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Christmas holidays are upon us. It’s time for shopping and relaxation. Commercial activities are in full swing. Advertisements flood TV, newspapers, and radio with a ton of last-minute promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a new business and you would like to advertise an event to attract new customers, you will sure to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribble Maps will make your life easier and help you create a map that can be shared on your digital channels, like social media, your website, and WhatsApp, with directions to your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that your business is in a small town in the Tuscan countryside that only the locals know. You have to look for a way to draw as many customers to you as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, you should consider major cities or populated areas around you. In this case the airports of Pisa and Florence and the cities of Lucca and Volterra. By entering the appropriate markers (nearby cities and airports) into Scribble Maps, you can bring potential customers to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the “Creating Directions feature” by entering a starting point, such as the Pisa airport, and set your business’s address as the destination. Repeat the same procedure for any remaining markers, like Lucca and Volterra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you have the final map containing all the information that you need.
How can we share it with other users?
We can include the map on the home page by following simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose Widget/embed from the Menu Toolbar
&lt;img src=&#34;map1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choose the map size
&lt;img src=&#34;map2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click preview to show how the map will appear like
&lt;img src=&#34;map3.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribble Maps can also be used to create simple and easy maps with directions to any business or even your next event.  Give directions to your favorite farmhouse. Or try it out for your wedding party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, share your experiences with us!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Geomarketing Market Research</title>
      <link>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/geomarketing_market_research/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 12:20:49 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/geomarketing_market_research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are going to show you some real examples on one of the most advanced functionalities of Scribble Maps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearby Search.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any time you have to travel to a new city, you would like to know in a short time, which could be the best area to choose your Hotel, B&amp;amp;B or farmhouse for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to find it, you would like to point out in your map where the most important services are located as per your interest. There are a lot of Apps that can help you by showing the hotels, restaurants, pubs, cinemas etc.
Scribble Maps simplifies it! Let us demontrate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you input a location such as Florence, to the search box, a new window will appear to help you to select the most popular categories from a list - such as Airport, Parking, Museum, Pharmacy, etc. You can also select the Range from 100 m to 50 km. This is an awesome functionality that is really useful in different contexts and analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;map1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are going to travel to some cities around the world you probably would like to know where the most important services are located. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transportation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Train Station&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultural places
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Museum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Movie Theatre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Useful services
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pharmacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Police&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to show you a case study in the center of Florence. Imagine that you are looking for a hotel that is near to the most important your amenities. We also would like to create an appealing map as usual with great icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;map2.png&#34; alt=&#34;alternative text for search engines&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to open a new business? Try with Scrabble Maps and let us know how is going!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Maps from statistical data</title>
      <link>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/maps_from_statistical_data/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 12:20:19 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/maps_from_statistical_data/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Access to weather information has increased enormously. Anyone with a smartphone has an app to check weather forecasts for at any given moment.
On a daily basis, we are flooded with information on the internet, TV, and radio about climatic events such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first snowfall in New York;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Milan&amp;rsquo;s airport closing due to fog;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Children and the elderly are asked to stay at home during the central hours of the day due to torrid weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we often find reports that show the temperature fluctuation, wind speed variability, and precipitation amounts in cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, we requested the annual average values gathered by the meteorological stations in the major cities of Tuscany.
Here is the excel report that we received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;annual_average.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We immediately thought about how to report this data in an interactive map so that we can make correlation analyses between the averages and the topographical features of the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scribble Maps helps us a lot in this. Thanks to the geocode service it will be simple to copy the data from the Excel sheet and paste them on the appropriate spreadsheet.
In just a few steps we got three heatmaps with georeferenced data through the geocode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We put a topographic layer as a basemap, for example, google terrain.
We can easily see that the lowest temperatures are recorded in the mountainous areas while the highest temperatures are in the locations closest to the sea.
The rainiest areas are close to the mountain ranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to replicate this analysis by taking other data from other weather stations in different regions or countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students could look for their own region and study the data on a table of an excel sheet first, trying to establish the characteristics of the meteorological station by analyzing the three parameters (wind, rainfall, and temperature). After making their deductions it would be interesting to import the data into Scribble Maps to display them on a map and check if their assumptions were correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we want to recommend another use of the statistical data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You could also represent the life quality of major cities in the world. At this 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/divrikwicky/quality-of-life&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;, we found a ranking. Now we already know how to proceed!
We have copied and pasted the data and created the map with the markers containing the ranking associated with the city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have other statistical data to analyze? For example, data on crime? on smog? on poverty? Share your experiences with us.

      <title>Make Thematic Maps Quickly</title>
      <link>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/make_thematic_maps_quickly/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 12:19:41 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/make_thematic_maps_quickly/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Assume that for some reason you need to create some worldwide thematic maps. The maps should contain the national borders, main cities, main communication routes, rivers and lakes. Let us suppose you have a short time to finish the job and you have absolutely nothing at all in your archive. In other words, we have to solve this problem by using only information available on Geospatial Data Portals such as Natural Earth, NASA Earth Observations, The FAO GeoNetwork…, and so on. Over the years they have started to release free sources from global to regional, from agriculture to soils, administrative boundaries, population, marinas, and other themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this premise justifies why to try Scribble Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we focus on some data coming from the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Natural Earth&lt;/a&gt; portal and we show how to manage and share Physical and Cultural Geography Information in an easy way through Scribble Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps below are created in a short time with an excellent graphics rendering. We just had to load the data and choose the right basemap as per the data contents. Below is the list of maps with the associated basemap:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_airports.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Airports&lt;/a&gt; =&amp;gt; Map Base Road;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/cultural/ne_10m_ports.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Marinas&lt;/a&gt; =&amp;gt; National Geographic Education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/physical/ne_10m_geography_regions_elevation_points.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Elevation Points&lt;/a&gt; =&amp;gt; Google Terrain;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.naturalearthdata.com/http//www.naturalearthdata.com/download/10m/physical/ne_10m_glaciated_areas.zip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Glaciated Areas&lt;/a&gt; =&amp;gt; ESRI Physical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These maps can be a good starting point to share and discuss the main global geographic topics with students.
For example, you may ask your students to collect videos and images related to the marker points around the world. Once they have finished collecting information for the 1st state it should be nice to share it to the rest of the class using Scribble Maps. 
In this activity, each student can analyze the different basemap archives from Google maps and other providers (ESRI, Open Street Map, Map box, …). Once they have analyzed the Maps generated at the global level they could check which the best basemap is for the chosen area at the local level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start, and share your maps with us!&lt;/p&gt;








  
  


&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Learn how to create your own custom web maps</title>
      <link>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/creating_custom_web_maps/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Mar 2019 12:17:21 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://fraeli78.github.io/post/scribblemaps/creating_custom_web_maps/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Google Maps released the API in 2005 Web maps became popular after giving web developers an easy way to drop custom apps in their sites with a minimal amount of new code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s Web maps are known as “slippy maps”. The user can freely pan and zoom in the map with fluid motions. The interface uses Ajax to dynamically load new portions of the map as needed without reloading the whole page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web maps are more prevalent now than ever before and they’ve never been easier to customize, match the look and feel of your interests to show:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contacts;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Searches;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Routing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical information forecasts based on scientific data or a live data;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scribble Maps&lt;/strong&gt; is an amazing framework for creating maps and is used by teachers to teach geography to students in a simple way. It is an effective medium to give your users geographic context for your data, services and your brand.
In addition, it works in a very properly way on mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scribble Maps&lt;/strong&gt;  is primarily focused on map performance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Map application stays small;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basemap tiles load fast;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pan/zoom actions are smooth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extra features are available through wide selection of plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Scribble Maps it is easy to build a new map. You can customize it to match your site, look and feel and you can use free open platforms to build them with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the following we would like to give you some ideas on how a map can be beneficial for your website applications and for your studies and how you can make maps interact efficiently and effectively with the different things that are going on in and around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various topics such as heat maps, big data and geolocation can be easily managed by Scribble Maps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  

  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scribble Maps&lt;/strong&gt;  can be summarized as it follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give you more control over how the google map is represented;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offers some really interesting options for taking your analysis, reporting and presentations up a notch;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates beautiful looking maps;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More efficient at how it uses information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scribble Maps&lt;/strong&gt;  is really a useful tool and will surely pave the way for a new approach for studying geography. As a matter of fact, it can be used by teachers and students as well as by companies and individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
